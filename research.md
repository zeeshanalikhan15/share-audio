chose windows as platform and c# as language

Libraries and Tools:

- NAudio: A .NET library for audio processing. [NAudio GitHub](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio)
- Windows Driver Kit (WDK): For developing the virtual audio driver. [WDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk)
- Windows Audio Session API (WASAPI): For interacting with audio devices.


### 1. Setup Development Environment

    Install Visual Studio with .NET SDK.
    Create a new C# project (Windows Forms or WPF for GUI applications).

### 2. Develop a Virtual Audio Driver

    For creating a virtual audio driver, you might need to use Windows Driver Kit (WDK) and write the driver in C or C++. This driver will act as a virtual audio device.
    Use the virtual audio driver to capture audio data and send it to your C# application.

### 3. List and Select Bluetooth Audio Devices

    Use the Windows Audio Session API (WASAPI) to list and interact with audio devices, including Bluetooth ones.
    Allow users to select Bluetooth audio devices as output devices.

### 4. Route Audio Data

    Capture audio data from the virtual audio driver.
    Use NAudio, a .NET library for audio processing, to route the audio data to the selected Bluetooth audio devices.

### 5. Develop User Interface

    Create a user-friendly interface to allow users to select the virtual audio device and the Bluetooth audio devices to which the audio should be routed.
    Implement controls for adjusting volume and other audio properties for each output device.

Example Code to List Audio Devices using NAudio:

```
using NAudio.CoreAudioApi;
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var enumerator = new MMDeviceEnumerator();
        var devices = enumerator.EnumerateAudioEndPoints(DataFlow.Render, DeviceState.Active);
        foreach (var device in devices)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{device.FriendlyName} - {device.DeviceFriendlyName}");
        }
    }
}

```
